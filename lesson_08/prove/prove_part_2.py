Course: CSE 351 
Assignment: 08 Prove Part 2
File:   prove_part_2.py
Author: <Add name here>

Purpose: Part 2 of assignment 8, finding the path to the end of a maze using recursion.

Instructions:
- Do not create classes for this assignment, just functions.
- Do not use any other Python modules other than the ones included.
- You MUST use recursive threading to find the end of the maze.
- Each thread MUST have a different color than the previous thread:
    - Use get_color() to get the color for each thread; you will eventually have duplicated colors.
    - Keep using the same color for each branch that a thread is exploring.
    - When you hit an intersection spin off new threads for each option and give them their own colors.

This code is not interested in tracking the path to the end position. Once you have completed this
program however, describe how you could alter the program to display the found path to the exit
position:

What would be your strategy?

Why would it work?
