# Assignment 10: Family Search

## Overview

This assignment requires you to retrieve family history information from a local server.  You will be implementing both a [depth-first algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHO6jU--GU) (aka. DFS) and [breadth-first algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86g8jAQug04) (aka. BFS).  Please refer to those two video links for more information on these alogrithms.  You will be retrieving family tree information from a server.  This server can handle multiple concurrent requests.  Each request takes the server 0.25 seconds to reply.

The assignment is divided into two parts.  The first part will retrieve the family tree information using DFS.  The second part will use BFS.

There are a number of classes in `common.py` that you can use:

**Person**

This class will decode and hold person details sent from the server.

**Family**

This class holds the family information from the server.

**Tree**

The tree class allows you to build a family tree from the families and individuals that you retrieve from the server.

## Assignment

### Assignment files

- `functions.py` - This is the Python file that you will be changing and submitting for the assignment.  **THIS IS THE ONLY FILE THAT YOU CAN MODIFY**.  It contains comments on how to call the server.
- `assignment.py` - This file contains main() and will call your functions in the `functions.py` Python file.
- `common.py` - Contains common classes and functions for the assignment.
- `runs.txt` - Contains which search algorithms will be run and how many generations will be retrieved from the server.  You can modify this file while you are testing your program.

### FS Server

There is a server program that you will need to run in it's own terminal window on your computer.  The program is `server.py`.  

1. Open a command or terminal window on your computer.
1. Go to the directory of the assignment.
1. Type `python server.py` to start the server.
1. Note if the server is very busy it might not reply with a 200 reply code or might return an empty JSON.  You should handle these issues in your program.
1. There are two API calls that you will be making to build your tree.  The details are found in `functions.py`.

While running, the server will display requests and replies from your assignment.  It also displays the current number of active threads making requests and the maximum number of threads.

### Part 1

- The function `depth_fs_pedigree()` will retrieve the family tree using a recursive algorithm.
- Your task is to use threads to make this function faster.  There is no limit on the number of threads you can use.
- You must build the pedigree tree starting with the starting family id.  You must write your program to handle different family information from the server (ie., number of families, number of children, etc.).  A family might be missing a parent and the number of children is random.
- You must retrieve all individuals in a family and add them to the tree object. (ie., husband, wife and children)
- Suggestion: get the function to work without using threads first.
- Do not use try...except statements
- **Your goal is to execute part 1 in under 10 seconds for 6 generations**

### Part 2

- In this part, you will be retrieving the family information using a breadth-first algorithm in the function `breadth_fs_pedigree()`.
- Your goal is to make this function as fast as possible by using threads.
- You must retrieve all individuals in a family (ie., husband, wife and children)
- Do not use recursion for this algorithm.
- Do not use try...except statements
- **Your goal is to execute part 2 in under 10 seconds for 6 generations**

### 10% Extra Bonus (Optional)

- A 10% bonus if you can limit the number of threads to 5 while retrieving the family information in part 2 using function `breadth_fs_pedigree_limit5()`.  
- The server must not have more than 5 active threads at a time. (watch the output from the server to see number of activity threads).  However, your program should try to have 5 active threads at a time.
- There is no time requirement for this extra feature.


### Misc

- The server will create a log file called `server.log`
- You assignment program will create a log file named `assignment.log`

## Rubric

**Describing your code**

In the header of the file `functions.py` is a place where you can give meaningful descriptions of part 1 and part 2.  If this is missing or incomplete, 10 points will be taken off your grade for this assignment.

Assignments are individual and not team based.  Any assignments found to be plagiarised will be graded according to the `ACADEMIC HONESTY` section in the syllabus. The Assignment will be graded in broad categories as outlined in the syllabus:

## Submission

- Add comments in the `functions.py` Python file in the header section describing how you sped up the program.
- You must clearly show in your code that you are using DFS and BFS algorithms.
- Upload only that Python file to I-Learn.
