Purpose: Retrieve Star Wars details from a server

Instructions:

- This program requires that the server.py program be started in a terminal window.
- The program will retrieve the names of:
    - characters
    - planets
    - starships
    - vehicles
    - species

- the server will delay the request by 0.5 seconds

TODO
- Create a threaded class to make a call to the server where
  it retrieves data based on a URL.  The class should have a method
  called get_name() that returns the name of the character, planet, etc...
- The threaded class should only retrieve one URL.
  
- Speed up this program as fast as you can by:
    - creating as many as you can
    - start them all
    - join them all
