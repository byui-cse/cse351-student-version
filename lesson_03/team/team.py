Purpose: Retrieve Star Wars details from a server

Instructions:

- This program requires that the server.py program be started in a terminal window.
- The program will retrieve the names of:
    - characters
    - planets
    - starships
    - vehicles
    - species

- the server will delay the request by 0.5 seconds

TODO
- Create a threaded function to make a call to the server where
  it retrieves data based on a URL.  The function should have a method
  called get_name() that returns the name of the character, planet, etc...
- The threaded function should only retrieve one URL.
- Create a queue that will be used between the main thread and the threaded functions

- Speed up this program as fast as you can by:
    - creating as many as you can
    - start them all
    - join them all
